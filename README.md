How are code files named?

If you look at the address bar at the top, you can find the "ID" of the contest. The letter denotes which problem I am 
solving in that round. For example, 1000A.cpp will be the solution to the Problem A of Round 1000 (Educational Codeforces Round #16)

What are the programming languages used?

     I often use C++ and Python for all competitive programming related code. However,
     I am open to other programming languages.
     
Are there any comments for the code?

     Generally speaking, no. However, I will try my best to make the code self-explanatory. The variable names and function name should imply what I am doing. It costs time to write comments in competitve programming, so the code may not fit very will for industrial purposes.
